- try use particules spawner, that are made to manage this kind of features -> maybe create a new one using conditions
 - reduce sound inside whith particules spawner
- improve trigger for changes of weather
- modifie volume of sound file to remove variable for gain of sounds

##New features that could be nice (suspended)
- add 2-3 more texture for snowflakes
- command set seconds to use weather
